# Found on redd-

Wait, I don't remember where I found codes in `cmds.txt`, I've just copy-pasted it from Internet (could be Reddit)

But it doesn't matter as most of them are echoed (so should be valid), but none of them actually work


## Useful resources

1. **[Thread on scootertalk.org](https://scootertalk.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=5767&sid=c95dfb412545bf261e185ef4c43b0801), seems to be most useful and provide fairly enough information**
2. [Thread on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScooterHack/comments/qtd7sl/lime_sj25_hack/), kinda useless but good to read
3. [Thread on scrooterhacking.org](https://www.scooterhacking.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=242), some Java program I couldn't manage to run properly

There are other resources/threads but are kinda useless as they provide no/very little information about our scooters
