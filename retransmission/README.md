# Retransmission

`retransmit.py` tries all possible commands from captured `HTerm` log (in `raw` format). Log should contain our desired turn-on command.

All you need to edit is target command length. All possibilities are tested with the specified length.

### How it works

Let's say we have a small captured payload (it's just an example):

`0xff, 0x14, 0x24, 0x69, 0xf0, 0xf1, 0x55, 0x00, 0x88, 0xf5, 0x99, 0x21, 0x37`

and, let's say we have target command length set to `9`. This is what the script will send to controller:

1. `0xff, 0x14, 0x24, 0x69, 0xf0, 0xf1, 0x55, 0x00, 0x88`

2. `0x14, 0x24, 0x69, 0xf0, 0xf1, 0x55, 0x00, 0x88, 0xf5`

3. `0x24, 0x69, 0xf0, 0xf1, 0x55, 0x00, 0x88, 0xf5, 0x99`

4. `0x69, 0xf0, 0xf1, 0x55, 0x00, 0x88, 0xf5, 0x99, 0x21`

5. `0xf0, 0xf1, 0x55, 0x00, 0x88, 0xf5, 0x99, 0x21, 0x37`

All you have to do during the script execution is to watch whether the scooter turns on.

Unfortunately, on fw version `1.9.0` and `2.4.xx` it didn't work for me.
