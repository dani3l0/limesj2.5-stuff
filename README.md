# limesj2.5-stuff

Here's some stuff I managed to do with scooter controller. Finally, I haven't turned it on...
But I'm sharing this as it might help someone.

Firmware versions I was working on:

- `LIS01_FW_1.8.5_201911162121000`

- `1.9.0` - I don't remember the full version

- `2.4.xx` - same as above


## What's here?

- A brute-force scripts to **guess** wanted command

- Some my brute-forcing results

- My captured logs during **turn-on-off** the scooter

- Some interesting log analysis

- Useful links

- Dumped and disassembled scooter's firmware

**In each directory of this repo there is a `README` file for more detailed information**


## What works?

Nothing. Maybe except led blinking which can't be turned off later xD

**UPDATE:** I've managed to turn on the scooter twice, for more info see [logs](logs)
