# limesj2.5-stuff

Here's some stuff I managed to do with scooter controller. Finally, I haven't turned it on...
But I'm sharing this as it might help someone.


### Brute force commands

There's a `main.py` script to bruteforce some commands sent to controller via Serial interface.

```
# Install required modules
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
python3 main.py
```

To change bruteforced bytes, please edit `main.py`.



### Firmware

In `fw` dir I've uploaded dumped firmware (I guess) and disassembled ASM file.
Do with it whatever you want, I'm sick of it.



### What works?

Nothing. Maybe except led blinking which can't be turned off later xD
