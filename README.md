# limesj2.5-stuff

Here's some stuff I managed to do with scooter controller. Finally, I haven't turned it on...
But I'm sharing this as it might help someone.

Firmware version I was working on: `LIS01_FW_1.8.5_201911162121000`


## What's here?

- A brute-force scripts to **guess** wanted command

- Some my brute-forcing results

- Useful links

- Dumped and disassembled scooter's firmware

**In each directory of this repo there is a `README` file for more detailed information**


## What works?

Nothing. Maybe except led blinking which can't be turned off later xD
