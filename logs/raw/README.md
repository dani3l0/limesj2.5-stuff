# Raw logs

All logs I've captured with `HTerm`. Those contain lock & unlock commands under different conditions.

The transmission was captured between scooter's controller and the green GPS box.

I think file names are informative enough, so I hope there will be no problem in understanding what happens in logs

_Have fun!_
